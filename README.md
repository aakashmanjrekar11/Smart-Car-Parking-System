# ðŸš— Smart Car Parking System

- The main objective is to avoid the cramming in the car parking area by implementing an efficient car parking system along with a user-friendly application for an ease of use. 
- Normally at public places such as multiplex theatres, market areas, hospitals, function-halls, offices and shopping malls, one experiences the discomfort in looking out for a vacant parking slot, though itâ€™s a paid facility with an attendant/ security guard. The parking management system is proposed to demonstrate hazel free parking. 
- The proposed system consist of 4 IR Sensors , Arduino UNO , NodeMCU ESP8266 Module , RFID Reader and Tags , Buzzer. 
- Implementation involves minimal human interaction and provides a seamless parking experience thereby reducing a lot of time wasted by the user in parking his/her vehicle.
